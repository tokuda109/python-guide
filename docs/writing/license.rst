.. Choosing a License
   ==================

ライセンスの選択
=====================

Your source publication *needs* a license. In the US, if no license is
specified, users have no legal right to download, modify, or
distribute. Furthermore, people can't contribute to your code unless
you tell them what rules to play by. It's complicated, so here are
some pointers:

Open source. There are plenty of `open source licenses
<http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical>`_ available to choose
from.

.. In general, these licenses tend to fall into one of two categories:

一般的に、これらのライセンスは二つのカテゴリのうちのどちらかになる傾向があります。 :

1. licenses that focus more on the user's freedom to do with the
   software as they please (these are the more-permissive open
   source licenses such as the MIT, BSD, & Apache).

2. licenses that focus more on making sure that the code itself —
   including any changes made to it and distributed along with it —
   always remains free (these are the less-permissive free software
   licenses, for example, the GPL and LGPL).

The latter are less-permissive in the sense that they don't permit
someone to add code to the software and distribute it without also
including the source code for their changes.

.. To help you choose one for your project, there's a `license chooser <http://three.org/openart/license_chooser/>`_,
   **use it**.

プロジェクトでどれかを選ぶ時のサポートとして、
`license chooser <http://three.org/openart/license_chooser/>`_ というものがあるので **使ってみて下さい** 。

- MIT / BSD / ISC

  + MIT (X11)
  + New BSD
  + ISC

- Apache

**Less-Permissive:**

- LGPL
